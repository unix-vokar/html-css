  <h2>Vintage Photography</h2>
  <div> <p>Film photography all over the world not so long ago was going through hard times. Manufacturers were phasing out analogue product lines and switching to digital; amateur photographers and pros - actively filmed with digital cameras, camera matrices in smartphones became (and are becoming) more and more perfect.</p>

  <p>The film died by itself,  the amateurs themselves mastered digital cameras, manufacturers mastered the process of modernizing digital cameras, and everything went the same way: more megapixels, smaller dimensions and lighter weight.</p>

    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    <p>Smartphones and Instagram completed the story by making the photograph available to the masses, thus film cameras ceased to exist. Yet, there is a pint of exaggeration here, because, of course, there are real film photography fans who have begun to buy film in specialized stores, hunt for rare and especially interesting models of film cameras, send their favorite cameras for preventive maintenance to shoppes ... but how a massive hobby, which, at one time, led to the release of more than 21 million copies of the Smena-8 camera (the most produced according to <a href="https://kosmofoto.com/2020/03/these-are-the-most-produced-35mm-cameras-of-all-time/"style="color: darkgreen; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">this site</a>), the film seemed to cease to exist forever. </p>

    <h2>The Pendulum</h2>
    <p>But, like any pendulum, the pendulum of photography also has a reverse motion. Looking at the modern state of film photography, it should be stated that film should have regained its popularity, at least part of it. Look: despite the availability of almost the entire collection of music records on the web, Internet radio and conventional radio stations still exist; contrary to the rampant forecasts of futurists, there are also paper books; not giving a damn about any logic, there are CDs, vinyl records and cassettes...</p>
  </div>
    <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
    <h2>The Feeling</h2>
    <p>Moreover, all this not only exists but also feels good. Because there will always be people who value the smell of ink and the feel of paper at their fingertips more than saving space and time. There will be people who hear the difference between an analog recording from the 70s and a digital master recording from a modern studio. There will be people who value physical objects more than electronic ones, and there will be people for whom the uniqueness and originality of the process are more important than the ability to reproduce the result with a given accuracy at any time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
    <h2>Uniqueness</h2>
    <p>It is the uniqueness of each frame that attracts true photography lovers to the film. Professionals have a slightly different interest here: for them, rather, the opportunities offered by the photographic film are important; but the uniqueness of each frame plays a significant role here too: an artistic frame made on film has a special value because of this uniqueness. Analog photography forces its followers to improve slightly more than digital photography. A strictly measured number of frames on a roll of film is the very first and simplest motivator. Here you can't erase a frame you don't like and reshoot the composition: you can only take another shot. And it's not a fact that the moment will not be missed: light, shadow, shutter speed, aperture - all this plays a much greater role in analog photography than in digital photography. And you won't be able to change ISO in a film camera - light sensitivity is determined by the very film that you load into the camera.!</p>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
    <h2>Complexity</h2>
    <p>Analog photography is more complex than digital, and this is its advantage. Just like in the case of vinyl records: the correct setup of the turntable and the entire audio system for playing a record from a vinyl record is many times more difficult than simply pressing the "Play" button on a smartphone. Yes, you are not mistaken: complexity is a virtue and an advantage of any analog medium, be it an image or sound recording medium. And the more difficult it is to create, the higher its value. It's like with furniture from "IKEA" and furniture handmade in Italy: two very similar items will cost completely different money and will be so different in small details that it will not be difficult to distinguish them.</p>
